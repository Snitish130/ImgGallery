# ImgGallery
### Online gallery of images using Django
- We can upload an image with a description and tags.
- Each image can have tags(can be multiple tags) (eg. -
Sketch,Nature,Portrait,Cars,Wildlifeâ€¦)
- Paginate the pages (max 8 images per page)
- We can filter the images in the gallery by their tags (single or multiple). Selecting a
tag or some tags will show only the images with those tags in the gallery.
- Clicking an image in gallery will take us to a page for that specific image. Added two
buttons there to rotate the image 90 degree clockwise or anti-clockwise.
